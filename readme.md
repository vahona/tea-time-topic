## Structure of the code
  - Grabing some element which I might need.
  - teatopic variable for storing the store the data
  - First, I import the the data from the IPA which set in the fetchTopic function.
  - displayTeaTopic function is set to display the the data in html.
  - I create addNewTopic to allow the user to add a new topic.
  - handleClick function is created to listen all the tumbup and down button need to listen to.
  - updatetup and updateDown function is meant to increament form in the thumb up and down.
  - Last part is the event listener.
  - I've got lot of error on diplaying add topic and the increament which I totaly don't kwon what causes it, I'm trying to resolve it.
